Population categorized by \r\nage (4 quantiles, based on avail data)\r\nX care continuum (undiagnosed, diagnosed, treated)\r\nX natural history (5 CD4 stages, based on Cori et al. )\r\nX risk variation (2 levels of risk behaviour, not correlated with susceptibility)\r\n\r\nThere is assortativity within age groups. \r\n\r\nDefault parameters match incidence from Phillips PLoS One et al. & match cumulative diagnoses reported by PHE for London MSM. \r\n\r\nAlso simulates coalescent trees using rcolgem package. Trees are matched to sample times and sample states of available sequence data. \r\n\r\nMany parameters can be tuned to adjust the relative infectiousness by age X care X clinical stage X risk level. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
